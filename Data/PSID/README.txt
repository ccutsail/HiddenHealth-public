This folder contains Stata scripts that produce the PSID estimation files used by the Python code.
The raw PSID data files are large, publicly available (with registration), and not allowed to be redistributed by me.
To reproduce the PSID estimation files (in /Data/Estimation), do the following:

1) Register an account with ISR at simba.isr.umich.edu
2) In the PSID data center, search for the prior carts J263970, J264007, and J264114.
3) Download the raw data files and put them in this directory as J263970.txt, J264007.txt, and J264114.txt.
4) Run MakePSIDdataset.do in Stata; this is called by MakeEstimationDatasets.do.

The following is a list of all variables included in J264007, which has one data
entry per *individual* in the PSID.
